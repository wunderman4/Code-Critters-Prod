# Code Critters!

**For Programming Foundations finial project**

This app is a basic electron app with ReactJS being used to render the gameboard and cirtters. The idea is to have students write a function which takes the gameboard as an argument then return a string which will be their move choice. For the time being you can move the user by using the arrow keys. 

### User Choices
- "move": The user will attempt to move forward one space.
- "clockwise": The user will rotate 90 degrees clockwise. 
- "counter-clockwise": The user will rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise


You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start).
